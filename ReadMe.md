## Plot (and tank types)





### Dandelion Turret
*"The little blue tank came across what looked to be some form of dish antenna, scanning the surrounding area. The dish then rotated towards the little blue tank, firing off a signal. the area below the little blue tank flashed as a beeping sound heard rhythmatically increasing in freqency. The little blue tank moved away from the point as an orbital strike was called down."*
